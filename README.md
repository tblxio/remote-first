# remote-first

Sharing is caring â€“ our guidelines

Before we set up our remote-first principles, we prepared the company for the remote-forced reality by introducing Remote Work Guidelines which you can find here. 

Transitioning into a remote-first reality, we defined Remote-First Guidelines which are available here. If you need some inspiration on some initiatives to maintain the culture you built up before, we shared some examples here.

In the end, what was our secret recipe to come out stronger than ever as a company? We put it here for you.

Best Wishes from the tb.lx team
