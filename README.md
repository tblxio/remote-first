# remote-first

Sharing is caring â€“ our guidelines

Before we set up our remote-first principles, we prepared the company for the remote-forced reality by introducing Remote Work Guidelines which you can find [here](https://github.com/tblxio/remote-first/blob/master/Remote-work-guidelines.pdf). 

Transitioning into a remote-first reality, we defined Remote-First Guidelines which are available [here](https://github.com/tblxio/remote-first/blob/master/remote-first-guidelines.pdf). If you need some inspiration on some initiatives to maintain the culture you built up before, we shared some examples [here](https://github.com/tblxio/remote-first/blob/master/remote_initiatives.pdf).

In the end, what was our secret recipe to come out stronger than ever as a company? We put it [here](https://github.com/tblxio/remote-first/blob/master/Secret-recipe-for-remote-first.pdf) for you.

Best Wishes from the tb.lx team
